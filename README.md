# Installation

1. creating a folder which will contain our app and within it type the following command to create the JSON file containing all the information and dependencies: 
2. Use the command-line, npm i, to install Express, Express-Handlebars, and mysql npm.
3. Use the command-line "npm run seed
4. Now we create our main js file which will contain our application’s logic and name it “index.js”
5. To start creating, devouring using Express, use the command, node server.js and navigate in the
web browser to localhost:8080.
 6. Finally, let’s create a folder by the name of “public” in which we create a .css file and let’s call it “style.css” and we’re good to go.
